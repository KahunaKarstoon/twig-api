### Description
---
This repo contains the API for the Twig Project.

The API will enable CRUD operations on the DB.

WIP. See develop branch for more.

### Getting Started

### Releasing
To release a new version just bump the version with
- `npm version [<newversion> | major | minor | patch ]`

This will update package.json, commit the version update, git tag and push to master. The new tag will trigger the deployment build which will run the tests, static code analysis, build and deploy.
